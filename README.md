Snake Game 🐍

A classic Snake game built with Python using the tkinter library. The objective is to control the snake, eat food, and grow as long as possible without colliding with the walls or its own body.
🎮 How to Play

    Control the Snake:
        Use the arrow keys (↑, ↓, ←, →) to control the direction of the snake.
    Eat the Food:
        The snake grows longer each time it eats the food, and your score increases.
    Avoid Collisions:
        If the snake hits the walls or its own body, the game is over.
